# Cypress testing framework 

Front-end automated test framework for the login page at https://www.saucedemo.com/ using Cypress. 

To run the tests after forking and cloning the repository install cypress using the command `npm install cypress --save-dev`. Once this is installed `run npx cypress open` to open the Cypress launchpad. On the menu choose E2E testing and open a web browser. Choose the file spec.cy.js and each of the tests will run with a description to show what is being tested. You can use the panel on the left to see if any of the tests have failed and which ones have passed.

If you are using a different package manager you can find the installation instructions at https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress and instructions to open the app at https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app.
